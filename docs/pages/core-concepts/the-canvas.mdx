# The Canvas

Luke Flow Diagram provides a powerful canvas for building interactive diagrams.
The canvas is the central area where nodes and connections are displayed, allowing users to visualize and interact with their data.


You can interact with canvas by using your mouse or touch gestures.
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and click and drag to pan around the canvas.
You can also use touch gestures on mobile devices to achieve the same effect.

> On mobile devices, there is a bug where you cant connect nodes by dragging from one socket to another.
> This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.
