# Overview
Luke Flow Diagram is a library that helps you create beatifull and interactive visual flow diagrams for your flutter application.

A Flow Diagram has multiple components: LukeFlowCanvasController, LukeFlowCanvas, Nodes, Sockets and Connections.

## LukeFlowCanvasController
This is a controller that allows you to programatically interact with you FlowCanvas with all the other components.
You can use it the acces the state of the diagram or execute commands that will update the diagrams internal data.

```dart
final controller = LukeFlowCanvasController<YourDataType>();
```
After creating an instance of a controller, you need to bind it on the Canvas like this:

```dart
import 'package:luke_flow_diagram/luke_flow_diagram.dart';

class MyFlowCanvas extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = LukeFlowCanvasController<YourDataType>(); // [!code focus] 

    return LukeFlowCanvas<DataModelExample>(
        controller: controller, // [!code focus] 
        nodes: nodes,
        initialConnections: connections,
    );
  }
}
```

## LukeFlowCanvas
This is a widget where the diagram is rendered with all its components.
