# Overview
Luke Flow Diagram is a Flutter library that allows you to build beautiful and interactive visual flow diagrams for your applications.

A flow diagram consists of several components: 
- `LukeFlowCanvasController`
- `LukeFlowCanvas`
- `Nodes`
- `Sockets`
- `Connections`

## LukeFlowCanvasController
The `LukeFlowCanvasController` enables programmatic interaction with the `LukeFlowCanvas` and all its related components.
You can use it to access the current state of the diagram or to execute commands that update the internal data of the diagram.

```dart
final controller = LukeFlowCanvasController<YourDataType>();
```
Once youâ€™ve created a controller instance, bind it to the canvas as shown below:

```dart
import 'package:luke_flow_diagram/luke_flow_diagram.dart';

class MyFlowCanvas extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = LukeFlowCanvasController<YourDataType>(); // [!code focus] 

    return LukeFlowCanvas<DataModelExample>(
        controller: controller, // [!code focus] 
        nodes: nodes,
        initialConnections: connections,
    );
  }
}
```

## LukeFlowCanvas
This widget renders all the visual elements of your diagram, including nodes, connections, and other UI components.

```dart
// Basic Luke Flow Canvas example // [!code focus] 
LukeFlowCanvas( // [!code focus] 
  controller: controller, // [!code focus] 
  nodeBuilder: (node) { // [!code focus] 
    //Here you can render any widget that will be displayed as a node // [!code focus]
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
      child: Material(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
        color: Colors.black,
        child: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsetsGeometry.all(10),
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Text(
                "This is a node",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }, // [!code focus] 
) // [!code focus] 

```

## Nodes

Luke Flow Diagram is highly flexible and customizable. You can define your nodes using any widget via the `nodeBuilder` property on `LukeFlowCanvas`.
We also provide example nodes to help you get started quickly.

## Sockets
A Socket (also known as a port) is a point on a node where connections can attach.
You can fully customize the appearance and positioning of sockets using the `socketBuilder` property on `LukeFlowCanvas`.

## Connection Edges
Connection edges are the lines that link one node to another (or even to itself), defining the flow of data in your diagram.
You can use the built-in customizable edges provided by Luke Flow Diagram, or you can implement your own.
